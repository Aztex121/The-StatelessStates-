## Executive Summary
The **StatelessStates™** framework is the foundational conceptual layer underlying **The Mother Core**, **QuantumSim**, **GENESIS BLACKBOX**, and the **Event Horizon Architecture (EHA)** — the structural perimeter and connective fabric of the Genesis Systems ecosystem.  

**EHA** defines the zero-trust, multi-layer security model that shields and links all Genesis modules, while **EHA Networks** extend those principles across distributed infrastructures — enabling sovereign-grade operation, adaptive routing, and containment across domains.

Together, these systems form a harmonized intelligence and security stack where AI, quantum logic, and network architecture converge.

While **The Mother Core** provides the technical modules, **StatelessStates™** serves as the design philosophy, adaptive state model, and strategic narrative driving cohesion, autonomy, and multi-domain interoperability.
